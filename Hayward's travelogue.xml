                <p>Arrival at <placeName type="city" style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Quebec</placeName>, and train journey <placeName type="city" style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Quebec</placeName> to <placeName type="city" style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Vancouver</placeName></p>
                <p><lb/>Arrival at <placeName type="city" style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Quebec</placeName> about <time type="clock">8.30 p.m.</time> 
                    <lb/>Ships time. <date n="13th" style="font-style: italic; color: red"> Monday </date> night. 
                    <lb/>The sight almost beggared description - 
                    <lb/>land on each side, whilst the
                    <lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi> on each side were numerous, 
                    <lb/>The land looks like waste, with green 
                    <lb/>dotted here and there.</p>

                <p><lb/>The day was really glorious, scarcely a 
                    <lb/>ripple on the sea; whilst just after sea 
                    <lb/>the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: orange">sunset</hi> was lovely, particularly 
                    <lb/>the effects behind the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi>.</p>

                <p><lb/>On deck the effect was beautiful - 
                    <lb/>lights twinkling all round the
                    <lb/>harbour, whilst these was not a 
                    <lb/>ripple on the sea; in fact the effect
                    <lb/>was even better than the exhibition.</p>

                <p><lb/>Swarms of telegraph lads 
                    <lb/>came about at night, taking 
                    <lb/>down messages for relatives etc.
                    <lb/>when we finally retired after enjoying

                    <lb/>
                    <lb/>the view, we were all too excited 
                    <lb/>to sleep.</p>

                <p><lb/>Up at <time type="clock">4.0 a.m.</time>, and up on deck 
                    <lb/>at <time type="clock">4.30 a.m.</time>, watching unloading 
                   <lb/>of cargo, and dodging more and 
                   <lb/>more telegraph messages.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>Breakfasted at <time type="clock">5.0 a.m.</time>, then all 
                   <lb/>waited impatiently orders to go 
                   <lb/>ashore.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>About <time type="clock">6.30 a.m</time>; we landed and 
                   <lb/>straightway were ushered to-
                   <lb/><name type="place" style="font-style: italic; color: green">Immigration Offices</name> (adjoining
                   <lb/>the quay) where we had our 
                   <lb/>Rail-Orders examined. We then 
                   <lb/>had to leave our portable
                   <lb/>luggage in a large room, 
                   <lb/>and were herded for Doctors
                   <lb/>Examination.
                   <lb/>This consisted of going down a 
                   <lb/>long passage (men hats off) and
                 
                <pb n="3"></pb>
                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>the examination consisted of a 
                   <lb/>nod to focus on.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>After being questioned as to means, 
                   <lb/>we then renewed our mail address,
                   <lb/>and was then instructed to go to
                    <lb/><name type="place" style="font-style: italic; color: green">Luggage Dept</name>, to claim same, have
                   <lb/>it examined by Customs, then to get 
                   <lb/>ticketed by fly, after which it 
                   <lb/>would be forwarded.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>As we were on the way to the 
                   <lb/>shed, we were claimed by representative of 
                   <lb/>various religious <add>bodies</add> and introduction 
                   <lb/>tickets handed to us by church of 
                   <lb/>England clergymen whilst we also 
                   <lb/>received packs etc.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>On reaching the luggage shed, 
                   <lb/>We soon found my box, but
                   <lb/>not the cases, which after patient 
                   <lb/>searching we found far away.
                    <lb/>I soon found a <name type="person" style="font-style: italic; color: green"> Customs official</name>,
                   <lb/>who asked a question or two,
                
                <pb n="4"></pb>
                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>and then passed my boxes (I
                   <lb/>might incidentally mentions that I
                   <lb/>ripped him <num type="percentage"> 8% </num> at first). After a 
                   <lb/>slight delay, a small lift arrived
                    <lb/>up a <name type="person" style="font-style: italic; color: green"> railway officer</name>, who labelled
                   <lb/>my boxes, so then we returned
                   <lb/>to our portable luggage.</p>
                    
                <p><lb/>We waited for an hour, and 
                   <lb/>then got on the train, (after making
                   <lb/>Sunday Journalists) and prepared
                   <lb/>for our journey, but, to our 
                   <lb/>dismay, we had a 3 hours wait 
                   <lb/>'eve stacking.</p>
                    
                <p><lb/>A <num type="percentage">2%</num> lift got about 1 ll<note>unit</note> of cheese, 
                   <lb/>1 ll<note>unit</note> of butter, and 6 small boxes 
                   <lb/>from the steward, whilst we bought 
                   <lb/>two loanes here (5 cents each) 2 pieces 
                   <lb/>of cowned beef (small) a bottle of 
                    <lb/>milk (10 cents) and other <unclear reason="illegible" cert="low"></unclear>dices
                   <lb/>A young fellow from Radford (who 
                   <lb/>knows Mr. <persName style="font-style: italic">Attenllorough</persName>) is with us.

                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>and as the train is crowded, 
                   <lb/>we have arranged to sleep on 
                   <lb/>the seats (which pull out and meet) 
                   <lb/>and leave our goods in the 
                   <lb/>hammock as I should say — 
                   <lb/>sleeping bed, which is of wood. 
                   <lb/>no mattress or anything.</p>
                
                <p><lb/>We are now moving along 
                   <lb/>nicely,<note change="deletion">there is a word covered by a black line</note>，the scenery is lovely 
                   <lb/>and the day beautiful.</p>
                    
                <p><lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">Fields</hi> abound on every side, with 
                   <lb/>horses dotted here and there, 
                    <lb/>and there is a range of <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi> 
                   <lb/>all along one side, which makes
                   <lb/>a shrinking picture; in fact I keep 
                   <lb/>looking as I write, and it is 
                   <lb/>most lovely.</p>
                    
                <p><lb/>There is a Canadian opposite us 
                   <lb/>who has given us many useful 
                    <lb/>hints, a man from <placeName type="city" style="font-weight: bold; color: blue">Nottingham</placeName>

                   <lb/>
                   <lb/>Have now got into the <placeName type="topographical" style="font-weight: bold; color: green">Rockies</placeName>, and 
                   <lb/>they are a grand sight, but with

                 <p><lb/>Just had breakfast + have stopped

                     <lb/>Was stopped here 2 hours at <time type="clock">2-0 a.m.</time> 
                    <lb/>shunting to so have been viewing 
                    <lb/>the scenery since.</p>
                    
                 <p><lb/>It is wonderful and needs the 
                    <lb/>pencil of an artist to describe, 
                    <lb/>and even then he could not do 
                    <lb/>it full justice.</p>
                    
                 <p><lb/>We have been running through 
                     <lb/>these vast <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi>, with great 
                    <lb/>peaks flanking on other side, 
                    <lb/>snow covered, and look perfect 
                     <lb/>when down in the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">valley</hi> these
                     
                 <pb n="25"></pb>
                    <lb/>
                    <lb/>
                    <lb/>are miniature wakes:
                    <lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">falls</hi> and <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">streams</hi>, and the 
                    <lb/>colour is a beautiful sea:
                    <lb/>blue and it is one constant charm to watch.</p> 
                     
                 <p><lb/>Right from the main lines 
                     <lb/>to the top of the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountain</hi> 
                     <lb/>are huge <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">trees</hi>, very much 
                     <lb/>like his knees, ranging from <num type="cardinal">10</num> to <num type="cardinal">40</num> feet in height.</p> 
                     
                 <p><lb/>Have passed through the 
                    <lb/>Great Loop (picture 5,053)
                    <lb/>of views 9 am sending,
                    <lb/>but the view does not 
                    <lb/>do justice to the scene.
                    <lb/>The rail looks very 
                    <lb/>fragile, but is quite safe.
                    <lb/>We have just passed one 
                    <lb/>of the prettiest likes of the 
                     
                 <pb n="26"></pb>

                     <lb/>
                     <lb/>whole journey.   A <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">river</hi> 
                     <lb/>about as wide as the 
                     <lb/><unclear reason="illegible" cert="medium"></unclear>ent, with lonely green 
                     <lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">ferns</hi> + <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">trees</hi> beyond, whilst 
                     <lb/>in the back-ground is 
                     <lb/>these large <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi>, with 
                     <lb/>the peak of the centre one 
                     <lb/>snow covered - it is more 
                     <lb/>than beautiful.</p>
                     
                  <p><lb/>Again the scenery is — 
                     <lb/>changed, and we are on 
                     <lb/>the top of a large <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">valley</hi>, 
                     <lb/>down on our left is voiced 
                     <lb/>coloured foliage, with little

                     <lb/>whilst to the night are huge 
                     <lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">trees</hi>, with varying coloured 
                     <lb/>foliage, and a huge 
                     <lb/><hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountain</hi> frowning down; 
                     <lb/>On the left hand a descent

                 <p><lb/>Some of the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">mountains</hi>, 
                     <lb/>seem to taper into the 
                     <lb/>very heavens above, and 
                     <lb/>with the peaks snow covered 
                     <lb/>the effect is grand, it shows 
                     <lb/>nature at the next, and 
                     <lb/>one feels the insignificance 
                     <lb/>of human beings, against 
                     <lb/>the works of the almighty.</p>

                     <lb/>are many crevices, and

                     <lb/>Have just arrived at <unclear/>
                     <lb/>There is a nice view here, and 
                     <lb/>a boat-house, and it looks so 
                     <lb/>calm and peaceful, and many 
                      <lb/>people are on the <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">river</hi>; the 
                     <lb/>banks are huge green slopes, and 
                     <lb/>snow-capped peaks in the 
                     <lb/>distance add enchantment.</p> 
                     
                  <p><lb/>We have been for a very 
                     <lb/>loving time running alongside 
                      <lb/>a large <hi style="font-weight: bold; color: green">lake</hi>, called <unclear/>, 
                     <lb/>and it is an ideal place.</p>
                     
                  <p><lb/>Many people have been 
                     <lb/>getting in + out at stations 
                     <lb/>during the last 5 hours, some 
                     <lb/>for fishing, some shooting, others 
                     <lb/>boating, partying etc.</p>
                     
                  <p><lb/>The scenery is indeed 
                     <lb/>lovely, and more enchanting 
                     <lb/>spots could not be found.</p>
